            <p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).
            Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an
            alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer's internal hardware
            is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen,
            and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating
            systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.
            
            Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing
            games, content creating, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.</p>
